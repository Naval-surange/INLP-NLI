## Introduction

This repo contains the code for the project on Natural Language Inference. The repo is divided into 3 parts as following

1. Baselines - Contains code for LSTM and Bert based baseline models
2. FLAN-T5 - contains code for inferencing using FLAN-T5 on SNLI and MNLI datasets
3. Roberta+selfExplain - Contains code for inferencing using Roberta + selfExplain layer on SNLI and MNLI datasets 

Each of the above folders contains a README.md file which explains the code and how to run it.

apart from that there is a report.pdf which contains all the information about these models and the results obtained.

## Datasets
in order to run the above codes, download snli and mnli datasets and extract them in each of the folders, if any other files are needed procedure to download will be provided in their readme file.

SNLI - [HERE](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/snli/)
